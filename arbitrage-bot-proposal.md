## Project Proposal - Paige Hand

## Project Name

Arbitrage Bot (Flash)

## Individual/Group

Individual

## Learning Goals

- Learn Solidity (Blockchain Development)
- Learn Ethers.js 
- Learn Ethereum Blockchain Workings

## Project Description

This bot will serve a crucial role to decentralized markets on the blockchain by equalizing coin prices between decentralized exchanges on the Ethreums Blockchain. By way of Solidity smartcontrats, Javascript, and Ethers.js this bot will look for differences in price of Magic token between two Uniswap V3 and Sushi. Once found it will use the lending platform Aave to loan only enough to make the price of the one coin equal between exchanges. The transaction will only take place if the trade makes a profit, and that profit will be stored in a hot wallet -- bots dont work for free. #robotrights

## MVP Feature Set

1. the user can see direction in the terminal to type s or q to start or quit the bot   
2. when the bot finds a transaction it will display a success message in the terminal "located"
3. when the bot completes a transaction it will display a success message in the terminal "traded"
4. if the transaction fails the bot will display a message in the terminal "failed"
6. 
  -  
7.  a user can see a map with point locations of all seattle parks
	- the map point locations will indicate (by color or symbol) whether the user has visited the park yet
	- the user can zoom in and out of the map 
	- the map also shows the user's current location
8.  the user can select a park point location, which navigates to a park details page.
	- if the user is signed in, the park details page shows whether or not the user has been there and a date of visit, if so
9. a user can sign into the app to see their saved data
10. the user has an account details/achievements page
	- the page shows how many parks they have visited
	- the page shows the points or badges earned
11. the user can see a page of general info about the game app (how to use, datasets involved, etc.)

## Stretch Features

1. Front-end showing a live feed of the current price of Magic token on Uniswap V3 and Sushi Swap.
2. Display a Start button
3. After clicking the start:
4. Display when the bot is checking for a price difference.
5. Displays a Stop button
6. Display when the bot has found a profitable difference.
7. Display when the bot has completed the transaction.
