## Project Proposal - Paige Hand

## Project Name

Arbitrage Bot (Flash)

## Individual/Group

Individual

## Learning Goals

- Learn Solidity (Blockchain Development)
- Learn Ethers.js 
- Learn Ethereum Blockchain Workings
- Learn dApp API 
- Learn MongoDB (maybe)
- Learn MetaMask innerworkings 

## Project Description

This bot will serve a crucial role to decentralized markets on the blockchain by equalizing coin prices between decentralized exchanges on the Ethreums Blockchain. By way of Solidity smartcontrats, Javascript, and Ethers.js this bot will look for differences in price of Magic token between two Uniswap V3 and Sushi. Once found it will use the lending platform Aave to loan only enough to make the price of the one coin equal between exchanges. The transaction will only take place if the trade makes a profit, and that profit will be stored in a hot wallet -- bots dont work for free. #robotrights

## MVP Feature Set

1. the user can see direction in the terminal to type s or q to start or quit the bot   
2. when the bot finds a transaction it will display a success message in the terminal "located"
3. when the bot completes a transaction it will display a success message in the terminal "traded"
4. if the transaction fails the bot will display a message in the terminal "failed"

## Stretch Features

1. Front-end showing a live feed of the current price of Magic token on Uniswap V3 and Sushi Swap.
2. Display a Start button
3. After clicking the start:
4. Display when the bot is checking for a price difference.
5. Displays a Stop button
6. Display when the bot has found a profitable difference.
7. Display when the bot has completed the transaction.
